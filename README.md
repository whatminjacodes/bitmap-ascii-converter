# bitmap-ascii-converter
Converts Bitmap files to ASCII graphics. Project was done because I wanted to work with C++ and was interested in how Bitmap files are read

WIP, not finished

#### Current features:
- read Bitmap file into Bitmap object bit by bit using Bitmap header

#### Features that need to be added:
- use the read pixel data and convert to ASCII characters
- save the new image
